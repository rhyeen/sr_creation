# Shardrealms Creation App

## Introduction

The Shardrealms Creation App, or SR Creation, is an Angular, Node.js, and MySQL web application for keeping track of complex relationships of elements within a dynamic story.  In layman's terms, it's an application RPG game masters to better keeping track of their campaign stories.

If you want to learn more about the vision of SR Creation, and the roadmap of development, you can read the [SR Creation Trajectory documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PA-q3xuqiZ23GHVwhrXzh8W-luoWdYA5hnjD1i4PKU0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage

Currently, SR Creation is in alpha development and will not be useable by the general public for some time.  Once ready, it will be deployed to a public server for use.

SR Creation can also be setup on a local server.  Follow the setup instruction below for more details.

## Setup

It is recommended that you run the Front-end, Server-side, and Database (see **Usage**) independently and under the recommended setup instructions found on each of those repos.  All three must be running concurrently for the application to function as intended.  See the individual repo's base README for more information on setup.

## Demo
